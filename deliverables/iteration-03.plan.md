# Ratatouille / team 23

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Mar 15 2018
 * End date: Mar 30 2018

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration
 
 * The most significant process decision our team made is that we exchanged two member's tasks in order to cope with upcoming deadlines.
 * This decision is successful because it ensures to avoid the situation where a member is assigned with a task but he/she could not complete it on time due to various reasons. 
 * In addition, it helps us to make significant progress during the final few week of school when all of us are busy with other courses since each of us are comfortable with the assigned task. 
 * The success metric we are using is the number of tasks that are completed versus the tasks that are not completed; for the previous iterations this metric worked quite well since it tells us if we assigned tasks correctly to team members.

#### Roles & responsibilities

The tasks/features assigned to each members are as follow:
* Helen (Ke Lan): Review/rating submission page
* Vlad: Chat page
* Mariko: Display page for the reviews/rating
* Akanksha: Itinerary form
* Emil: The video, map page
* Mike (Yu Xuan): Favourite page

#### Events
 

 * Frequent small "meeting" on Facebook where we discussed about problems we faced during coding.
 * In person meeting Mar 15 2018: Discuss what features should be implemented for this iteration as well as assigning tasks.
 * In person meeting Mar 29 2018: Code review session.
 * Skype meeting March 30 2018: Finalize all the features as well as solving coding or design problems.


#### Artifacts
   
 * Again we will be using the task-board on Asana, we create a sub-board with the meeting date as the name and log any notes / tasks that needs to be done as the tab that falls under the board.
 * Notes from in person meeting that indicates the task assigned to each member.


#### Git / GitHub workflow

* Our Github workflow did not changed from the last iteration. 
* We use the basic git workflow for our project, that is, test code locally -> pull from master -> commit -> push to master. We chose this type of workflow due to the structure of our project: each functionality is separated into different files so we rarely run into conflicts if we work simultaneously. 
* In addition, this gives us a faster workflow since we don't need to have one person that reviews every commits.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks
 

 * The goal for this iteration is to finish all the features for our app that we planned to do from iteration-01, we specifically want to prioritize the functions that were supposed to be finished in iteration-02.
 * Task 1: Initial meeting to discuss the general direction for this phase of the project, resolve questions related to android studio.
 * Task 2: Get familiar with using android studio because we ejected from EXPO, which means to test our code, the procedure is more complicated and time consuming.
 * Task 3: Distribute the remaining features for the app to group members.
 * Task 4: Make sure all of the features are done and tested.
 * Task 5: Minor tweaks to UI design if have time.


#### Artifacts
   
  * Similar to last iteration, the main artifact for this iteration will be the complete code for our application, however, our code will be mainly supported on Android.
  * We will produce some UI design sketches for some of the features implemented in this iteration.
  * In addition, we will provide screenshot of our discussion on Facebook on different matters, such as coding problem or design problem.
