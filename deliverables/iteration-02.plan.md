# Ratatouille / team 23 

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: February 22, 2018
 * End date: March 11, 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

* We will first identify the number of tasks (such as page views and functions) that are most important.
* Then distribute the tasks equally to each member as the responsibilities based on member's preferences and how much spare time they have.
* During the initial meeting, each of us will play a role in sharing and discussing ideas regarding to UI design and the specific functions for each of application page.
* After the initial meeting, we decided to implement views and functions for pages including log in / registration page, dashboard profile for service provider accounts, past order history for client accounts, service search page, message page and account setting page. 
* We then decided to assign each of the above tasks as follows: Log in/ Registration (Helen), Search Page (Vlad), Profile for clients (Mariko),Profile for service provider(Akanksha),Message page (Emil) and account setting page (Mike).


#### Events

We planned to host the following meetings during this iteration:
 * In person meeting - Feb 27th: Decide on a UI and distribute features to individual members to code.
 * In person meeting - March 1st: Coding session + review code + UI graphical layout designs 
 * In person meeting - March 9th: Progress result exchanges and some discussion relating to message function and problems encountered.
 * Online meeting - March 11th: On Skype call, each group member will discuss any final concerns and gather together to finalize the video and deliverable paperworks.


#### Artifacts

* By using the Task-Board feature on Asana, we create a sub-board with the meeting date as the name and log any notes / tasks that needs to be done as the tab that falls under the board.
* Any meeting schedules or extra notices will also be posted as tabs under the meeting date.
* The priority of tasks will be specially mentioned in the task tab to indicate its importance. 
* Tasks distributed in the meetings will be organized on Asana as log notes by priority. Tasks will be assigned to members based on their expertise and interest in the function. 

#### Git / GitHub workflow
 
 * Since we plan to split out tasks equally and each of the features are independent in files, we will be less likely to encounter code conflicts within the same JavaScript file. 
 * Above is the reason why our Git workflow focuses majorly in commiting to the master branch within the product directory.
 * Our current project product directory is named as "reactiveNativeStart" because we are now developing our project from the code mock up prototype. Once we have the project finalized, we will be renaming the product directory.
 * Each member is responsible to create the necessary file and implement the functions within that file. Then committing and pushing the new file to the product directory in the master branch.
 * If we encounter any conflicts in code, the committer is responsible to reach to the member who is responsible for developing that feature and together they need to discuss whose part to keep for final version.
 * Any changes made to another members file will be due to the interacting nature of the files.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

* The goal for this iteration is to produce a working application of our project with some of its most important and basic functionalities included (including both front end navigation and some back end functions such as database manipulation ). 
* The functions (as listed on Asana) are: Login page, Registration page, Account pages, Profile pages, Message board and Search page. 
* In order to complete our goal for this iteration, we briefly list the following tasks with descending priorities:
* Task 1: Initial meeting to identify which features are most important and basic 
* Task 2: Distribute the features as tasks to each team member as their responsibilities for this iteration
* Task 3: Have the front end (Graphic UI) implemented and partial back-end functions implemented and make sure they work properly
* Task 4: Meeting to decide on a final UI theme design / layout
* Task 5: Finalize UI designs on the application


#### Artifacts

* The main artifact for this iteration is the actual application codes that can be tested on both Android and IOS platform using Expo.
* Without showing the actual application and its code, we cannot present our project to the audiences.
* We will also produce sketches of the UI design and use it as the major reference on how to implement the front end designs (i.e. Button location and shapes, Text front, major theme color, icons, etc)
* In addition, we will also provide screenshots of the discussion board (Asana) we use to brainstorm features of different pages. These are useful to our team as a back reference because when any of us is confused about the current progress, we can always refer back to the notes on Asana and continue working from there.
