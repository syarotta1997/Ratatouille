# Ratatouille / team 23


## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: APRIL 1st, 2018
 * Where: ONLINE (SKYPE)

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

 
* The most important process that turned out to be successful is the decision of switching the task of message (chat) and map page in between our group members and that we are able to achieve the complete state of our application. By complete state it refers to 95% of our initially planned functions are live-working on both front end and back end. 
* In fact, our message function plays a crucial role in placing / inquiring about an order. Thus without making this decision, we will not be able to finish this function on time, nor that we will even have a complete working product.
* The second process that turned out to be successful is the decision of distributing tasks based on member's skills and spare time.
* This decision is successful because by distributing the tasks based on experiences and available time, we do not over-stress team members on the amount of workload and this improved our process efficiency in terms of having each member taking a share in developing the application in parallel (although each member still has a great amount of work to do, this decision is way better than leaving everything for one experienced member and have all other members left with little/no contribution).


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
 
 * The decision of ejection from EXPO to Android Studio may not be as successful as we have expected.
 * Ideally, we expected the switching from EXPO will not only resolve compatibility problems but also retains the simplicity of testing.
 * Although this ejection did resolve the problem of incompatible library import issues, it costed a great time for the team members to set up the bread new virtual testing device as well as the time it takes to relaunch the server everytime we test the application. However this decision is necessary and we admit the tradeoff between time and a working product result is reasonable.
 * The second decision that did not turned out so well ()



#### Planned changes
 
 * Since this is the last iteration before submitting the final product, we barely have any time to make process-related changes and to perform these change decision.
 * However we are satisfied with all decisions we made so far, thus we do not see any further need for new changes.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 
 * Following is the list of tasks that are completed:
 * Task 1: Initial meeting to discuss the general direction for this phase of the project, resolve questions related to android studio.
 * Task 2: Get familiar with using android studio because we ejected from EXPO.
 * Task 3: Distribute the remaining features for the app to group members.(as displayed in Asana screenshot)
 * Task 4: Make sure all of the features are done and tested.(to be updated)
 * Task 5: Minor tweaks to UI design (changing CSS style of header, improved layout of lists)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
 
 * We claim that all of the goals and tasks planned are completed on time.

## Meeting Highlights
 
 * Since this is our last iteration of this project, we will barely have any chance for further insights of this application.
 * However in scope of outside the course, we may still continue to develop this application by making the current feature more robust and secure (i.e. robust as in platform compatibility across desktop, Android and IOS, whereas secure as in introducing background/licence checks, etc.)
