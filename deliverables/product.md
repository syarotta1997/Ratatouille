# Ratatouille - Team 23

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are building an IOS/Android app that provides a peer-to-peer platform for matching aspiring chefs/bartenders with food enthusiasts for a unique and personal experience. One of the main goals is to save time, energy and resources for people with inability to cook and people who have time-consuming agenda. Secondly, the platform provides exposure to relatively inexperienced food and drink artists to create and grow their portfolio, showcase their cooking techniques and make some profit while at it. In addition, it creates a community platform that connects clients to chefs based on diners' preferences, such as cuisine, class, location and price range. Diners will be able to book in advance for special events as well as get immediate service when they need it. Diners will also be able to get cooking lessons from chefs/bartenders in the comfort of home. All the reviews, portfolio and relevant information of users will be easily accessible from their profiles. We will also provide a scene for chefs/services providers to advertise their skills to the public, by means of online cooking contests and how-to guides.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

We classified our target users in two categories: 
* Diners - people with special needs who have difficulty to fully provide for themselves, such as elderly and people with disabilities. Another group in this category are people with time shortage due to busy daily schedule, who usually order-in or eat out for lack of time or energy. Diners, also include people who are hosting parties, events, and they can have high-quality dining/beverage service at a place of their choosing.
* Service Providers(bartenders, chefs, pastry chefs) - food enthusiasts, new graduates that have little-to-no experience in the service sector and big ambitions. Chefs who are always looking for the room to improve and expanding their horizon by making specialized meals for special needs of our customers.  

A chef that just finish his/her degree and is excited to start his/her career yet continuously hitting walls because most of the dream restaurant requires porfilio.
A person with disability is forced to eat fast foods everyday due to the inability to cook and needs healthy food.
Parties for a group of people, gathering including food and drink serving.
Here is a persona for a potential user for our application:

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

One of our competitors is https://www.hireachef.com/. They have a similar goal, however, they require chefs to have professional licenses. One of their advantages is an insurance policy for their services. One of their disadvantages is that they are only accessible through a website and hence they lack engagement with the mobile user base. Additionally, the act of picking chefs does not make use of modern practises(like using reviews from a client base, such as a star based rating system, to enable comparison between chefs). 

Our service would also be an alternative to ordering pre-cooked/ready-to-cook food from restaurants and other services such as https://chef2home.com/, https://www.blueapron.com/, https://just-eat.ca/. Ordering food from these services have some issues. For instance, hot food arrives cold and there is need for reheating, or ingredients of ready-to-cook meals are not as fresh as desired. Clients can also get weekly and daily recipes with fresh ingredients delivered to their doors through services like Blueapron or Chefsplate. These components have to be cooked and mixed together. Similarily our clients will benefit from the fresh ingredients however they save a lot of cooking time. Another issue with existing services are fees, that may be unreasonable sometimes. The Blueapron web app forces clients to subscribe to a plan. We would not be constricting our clients to a monthly fee and our application would be completely free of commitment. 
 

Our product takes into account both the user's desires as well as the chef's. It will allow the clients to specify their preferred ingredients based on health issues, dietary restrictions or nutrient content from which elderly and people with special diet needs would benefit. Clients would also be able to watch the chefs and learn from them for future reference, making this a much more informative process than simply ordering food from a restaurant. If a chef/bartender wanted to make a living cooking/mixing the type of food/drinks that they think their audience will enjoy, in the current world their alternative would usually be to start their own restaurant or catering company, the premise of the popular movie 'Chef'(2014). Unlike the cheap alternative that we offer as a solution to the chef's problem(that is to cook to his heart's desire), starting a restaurant is easily one of the most failed startup business ventures out there in the entrepreneurial world, with 60% failure rate within the first year(unlike the positive outlook of success that the movie Chef paints) according to an article by CNBC(https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/20/heres-the-real-reason-why-most-restaurants-fail.html).

### Highlights

As a team, we had difficulty finding ideas that were not previously implemented. The following are alternatives we considered.
An app that picked wine based on the user's meal. We did not pursue this idea because it did not convincingly solve a real-world problem.

An allergy avoidance checker. We did not expand on this idea because most people know their allergies and how to avoid them (i.e. can check ingredients in products before use or purchase). Additionally, it is very difficult to find a database that contains the ingredients for almost all of the product on the market. We also lack required medical information as we are not medical professionals.

An schedule combining application. We did not follow through with this idea due to the excessive number of competitors. We had difficulty finding features that uniquely enhanced such an interface. We were not able to find a solution to a problem that had not already been solved by the other competitors.

A fitness/diet helper application. MyFitnessPal is a very already a strong competitor on both web and mobile platforms with complete features and already huge user databases.

An application that scans/analyzes receipts/cheques and makes a report for the IRS or other financial services for contractors. A big variety of companies are already doing this, there are heavy competition and a heavily occupied market.

We reached our current idea after being inspired by the convenience of using uber and our needs as students to eat healthy while saving money and time (this is a healthier alternative to Foodora and its other competitors). Our product would allow its users to control their ingredients, by either choosing to specify them to the chefs or providing them based on what is already have available to them at the moment.

We choose to develop our application on IOS platform because: Web applications are not as easy to use as a phone application, in addition, a web application would need access to a PC whereas mobile applications can be used anywhere any time due to how extensively cell phones are used nowadays. Mobile applications provide a more instant approach compared to other catering options that are currently only available for web applications.

When comparing Android and IOS, the user base is dominantly using IOS platform in the US, and Canada, which is the area that we will be targeting. Secondly, from a monetary perspective, IOS statistically has a higher revenue stream from advertisements and users who are willing to pay when compared to users on the Android platform, which is vital to have users that will be engaging with the services we intend to provide.
